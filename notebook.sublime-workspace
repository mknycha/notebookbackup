Looks quite useful.\nIn order to use interactive_editor, add gem to `.irbc` file (to use it in irb)/ Gemfile (to use in rails console). Also add your editor to gem configuration\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n- Admins - transaction limits\n\t- Refactor methods in the admin model for accessing credit limits\n\t- Added specs for admin model\n\t- Corrected subtasks description, it turns out there are trouble\n- Pair programming with Nika\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Pair programming - part II\n- Admins - transaction limits\n\t- It turns out there are more concerns in the description than I thought. Rollover bonus is created by award bonus form, but also by award free spins and promotions. It is not clear when exactly to check the limits (and not to make existing bonuses blow up). Asked on Jira\n\n# Wed Jun 12 16:31:43 2018\n\n• Create custom build method for rollover bonus, validating the amount based on the source param passed to it - did not work. It looks like:\n- `build` method is defined on relation, not model. If override it one particular relation, we do not have an access to object instance (we can only pass additional params)\n- We cannot assign error to an object outside of methods used for validation. Whenever `.valid?` is called, object errors disappear and it is validated again. For instance:\n```\n[5] gaming_admin »  rb.errors.add(:tralala, 'tralalala')\n=> [\n  [0] \"tralalala\"\n]\n[6] gaming_admin »  rb.errors\n=> #<ActiveModel::Errors:0x007fe79d8806a8 @base=#<RolloverBonus id: 9, player_id: 646, amount: 0.1e8, state: \"cancelled\", rollover_requirement: 1, awarded_at: \"2018-06-12 13:35:07\", activated_at: \"2018-06-12 13:35:07\", expires_at: \"2018-06-13 13:35:07\", created_at: \"2018-06-12 13:35:07\", updated_at: \"2018-06-12 13:40:20\", award_maximum: 0.1e8, award_percentage: 0.1e3, affiliate_commission: nil, rollover_days_duration: 1, award_minimum: 0.1e8, source_id: 13, source_type: \"Admin\", exchange_rate: 0.2e1, currency_pair: \"BTCEUR\", comment: \"test\", cancelling_user_id: 13, cancelling_user_type: \"Admin\", funds_transferred: nil, exhausted_at: nil, models: [\"CasinoBet\"], sportsbook_minimum_price: nil, promotion_id: nil>, @messages={:tralala=>[\"tralalala\"]}>\n[7] gaming_admin »  rb.valid?\n=> true\n```\n\n# Wed Jun 13 16:31:43 2018\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n• Admins - transaction limits\n- Implemeneted validations for credit funds and award bonus (under player summary)\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n• Implement validations for bonuses/award created through promotions\n\n# Thu Jun 14 17:03:27 2018\n\n**Learned**\n- Start rails server with puma, not passenger - this way `binding.pry`/`byebug` will work, no need to use `binding.pry_remote`\n\n- For Codeship deployment private data (passwords, api keys etc.) we download the public key from codeship (if we have an access to it), and then use it to encrypt the private data and upload the encrypted data during deployment\n\n• Promotions create underlying rollover bonuses when `opt_in` method is called. The logic is in the `_reward` classes.\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n• Admins - transaction limits\n- Partially implemented limits for bonuses/awards created through promotions. Since `source` is needed for bonus validation, I decided to pass `source` to rollover bonus as a param on creation. I tested it locally for credit funds and award bonus, it worked. I have to test it if it’s fully working in case of promotions.\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n• Admins - transaction limits\n- Check `RolloverBonus` creation. Will passing `source` on creation not break anything? (make it required if so)\n- It looks like right now promotion is passed to RolloverBonus as `promotion` attribute. Where is this attribute used? Can it be replaced with `source`, so that promotion is passed as source and used the same way?\n\n# Fri Jun 15 16:35:08 2018\n\n**Learned**\n\n- VIM: To copy stuff to system clipboard:\n\t- Use the clipboard as the default register. Command: `set clipboard=unnamed`\n\t- Select stuff, and push ‘y’\n\n• It turns out that I can assign source on bonus creation for player\n\tsummary, but I cannot do it for bonus creation from promotions. To keep\n\tthe consistency, it will be better not to rely on source, but validate\n\trollover bonus in the form used for its creation.\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n• Admins - transaction limits\n  - As per the above, moved validation to the form. Tested in flightdeck, looks like it works.\n  - Started fixing specs\n\n**To do the following day**\n  - Fix the specs (remember about gaming_engine too) and make PR!\n\n# Mon Jun 18 16:28:17 2018\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n- Specs, minor fixes\n- Fixed forms validations in gaming_admin\n- Started working on admin edit view, make the limits editable in there but include checkbox 'default?'\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Admin new/edit view, limits fields\n- Review for Krzysztof and Maciej\n\n# Tue Jun 19 16:32:34 2018\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n- Worked on front end of admin edit view\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Solve the following problem: When user updates admin’s limit, how to change it back to nil when someone selects ‘use default’?\n\n- It is always possible to create a hidden form with nil param when ‘use default’ is checked, but there must be a better way in to do it in controller\n\n# Wed Jun 20 16:26:03 2018\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n- Front end and back end for the forms for edit/new admin. It looks like it works!\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Admins credit limits - double check everything and make a PR\n\n# Thu Jun 21 16:38:34 2018\n\n• Exclude Agents from Affiliates data in Affiliate Commission Report\n\t- It looks like the issue lies in the query. Probably ‘group_column’ is missing in the `group_by` clause\n\t- When ‘group by’ affiliate is chosen, ‘unknown’ is shown under affiliate column. Probably because Agents have `username` assigned, while Affiliates do not\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n- Admins credit limits - Last fixes to credit limits, created PR. Started working on comments to PR\n- Started working on an issue mentioned above\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Admins credit limits - comments from PR\n\n# Mon Jun 25 16:17:00 2018\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n- Implemented relations and methods on models that will be used for daily limit validations\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Check previous changes to the form validation. Do these work properly for daily limit validation?\n- Assign admin to the promotion_schemes on their creation. Assign admin to the rollover_bonus on their creation only from flightdeck. *It should not be assigned for those created by promotions, otherwise promotion bonus amount will be counted twice!*\n- Specs\n\n# Tue Jun 26 16:28:20 2018\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n- Implemented the daily limits validations, so far it looks like it’s working for credits, promotions and bonuses! :hype:\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Refactor. Maybe validation from files /Users/marcinknychala/bgl/gaming_engine/app/models/concerns/rollover_bonus_limits_validations.rb and /Users/marcinknychala/bgl/gaming_engine/app/models/concerns/promotion_validations.rb can be moved into one module/service? :thinking:\n- Clean the previous changes, especially from forms creation and translations\n- Respond/handle all PR comments\n- Specs\n\n# Thu Jun 28 17:17:50 2018\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n- Limits - refactored code, fixed specs, improved it according to the comments in PR under gaming_admin.

Not always task description is the best solution that can be applied. Good dev needs to think ahead and know what will be the impact of these changes, and propose a better solution if possible. If client wants a shopping mall, he does not need to know what material should be used for the building - it's up to the builder!\n\n**What I have done today?**\n\n- Limits - PRs are ready! :hype:\n- Code review for Krzysztof\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Pair programming with Krzysztof\n\n# Tue Jul  3 16:39:23 2018\n\n**Learned**\n\n• iTerm: Cmd + Shift + K -> clear the console window apart from what’s visible\n\n**What have I done today?**\n\n- Bug with commissions report for affiliates/agents - created PR\n- Credit and bonus limits - started working on comments and applied fixes…\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Credit and bonus limits - hope to finish :sad_pepe:\n\n# Fri Jul  6 09:05:12 2018\n\nTesting credit and bonus limits\n\n1) Go to the edit page of your logged in admin. I.e.: https://flightdeck-int.cloudbet.com/admins/16/edit. Below you should see admin limits fields: Manual credit limit, manual credit 24h limit, bonus credit limit, bonus credit 24h limit.\n - All the checkboxes 'use default' should be checked by default.\n - For any limit: if 'use default' is checked, there should be visible value from the corresponding setting and the field should be disabled. All the credit limits settings are stored under key_namespace 'payment::credit::limits'. For instance for manual credit limit the setting key will be 'admin_manual_credit_limit'.\n If user clicks save when 'use default is checked', it should save nil for particular field in db (see screenshot)\n - For any limit: if 'use default' is not checked, the limit field should be ready for user input. User should not be able to save the form with empty limit field or negative limit value. Once the value is put and saved, limit should be saved under corresponding field in the db (see screenshot)\nIt would good for you to write those limits somewhere or open this view in a separate window.\n2) Let's validate crediting funds by admin. Go to any player's summary page (i.e.: https://flightdeck-int.cloudbet.com/players/169/summary), then 'actions' -> 'credit funds'. You should not be able credit more funds than your manual credit limit. You also should not be able to credit more funds in 24h than your manual credit 24h limit. Please note that the limit value is in reporting currency. For instance, if you choose to credit 1 BTC, and the reporting currency is eur, the limit should converted to BTC and then compared. (reporting currency can be found under setting key_namespace: accounting, and key: 'currency')\n3) Award bonus through flightdeck - in player summary page select 'actions' -> 'award bonus'.\n - If you do not choose 'award on next deposit', you should not be able to save bonus with amount higher than the bonus credit limit. If you have already given bonus to different player, it should not be higher than bonus credit 24h limit.\n - If you do choose 'award on next deposit', you should not be able to save bonus with (award_maximum * award_percentage / 100) higher than the bonus credit limit. If you have already given bonus to different player, it should not be higher than bonus credit 24h limit.\n - Please make sure to test the above steps for both 'award on next deposit' bonus, and instantly awarded bonus.\n4) Bonuses awarded through promotions\n - First, create a new promotion scheme: go to https://flightdeck-int.cloudbet.com/promotions/new, as type of promotion select deposit bonus or free bonus. As scheme destination select flightdeck. If you have chosen deposit bonus, (award maximum * award percentage / 100) will be compared to the bonus credit limit. If you have chosen free bonus, amount will be compared to the bonus credit limit. Bonus credit 24h limits are compared the same way. Fill out other fields and save promotion scheme.\n - Now, go to player summary page. Choose 'actions' -> 'grant promotion'.\n - Select promotion scheme you have created. If the bonus for that promotion scheme exceeds any of the bonus credit limits, it should not be created.\n - Please make sure to test the above steps both for promotion type 'deposit bonus' and 'free bonus'\n\n# Wed Jul 18 16:51:47 2018\n\n**What have I done today?**\n\n- Credit and bonus limits - merged and tested everything, fixed migrations. Waiting for QA\n- Bestimate - discussion. How to divide tasks?\n- Withdrawal summary does not report anything - started working on this. When I wanted to test the concerned view and add some withdrawals, int.flighdeck did not work\n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Withdrawal summary does not report anything - continue looking for the root cause\n- Bump engine to include migration fixes!\n\n# Thu Jul 19 16:30:17 2018\n\n\n**What have I done today?**\n\n- Withdrawal summary does not report anything - I have found out, that \n\n**To do the following day**\n\n- Withdrawal summary does not report anything - continue looking for the root cause\n- Bump engine to include migration fixes!",
